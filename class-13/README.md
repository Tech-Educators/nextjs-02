# 13. Forms: building a comment form for the blog

## Overview

The simplest type of form to build (although perhaps not to moderate!) is the humble comment form. We're going to add one to our blog post pages, persist the comments to the KV store, and then display the comments on the page.

## Class Outline

- Lecture: Forms and APIs: How to submit form data directly to API routes, retrieve data from API routes
- Lab: Build your comment API and submission form

## Learning Objectives

- How to submit form values to an API route without JS
- Saving comments for each post in the key value store
- Retrieving and displaying comments on the post pages
- Redis functions set, mget, rpush, lpush, lrange, and more.
