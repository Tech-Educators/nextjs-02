## Overview

An introduction to Next.js. Why it exists, and where it sits within the front and back end development ecosystem.

## Class Outline

- Lecture and Discussion: Next what?

## Learning Objectives

- What is Next.js?
- Main features in Next.js
- Benefits of Next.js
- Dynamic rendering: Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Static rendering: Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Other competing frameworks are available

## Notes

üìù At the time of writing the new `/app` directory has been released as stable in Next.js 13.4, and Server Actions have been introduced as an experimental feature.

Questions to consider:

- What are the key benefits of using Server-Side Rendering or Static Site Generation with Next.js instead of client-side only rendering with Create React App?
- What are the primary differences between Server Side Rendering and Static Generation? Are there any advantages to one over the other in some situations?
