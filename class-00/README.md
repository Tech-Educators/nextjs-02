# 0. React Recap & Bare bones Next.js from scratch

## Overview

We are going to show a very basic demo of `create-react-app`. This will help show the difference between React with and without Next.
For real projects we'll be using `create-next-app` by default, but it's useful to understand the simple minimalist requirements for running a Next.js project.

## Class Outline

- Demo: Create a basic `create-react-app` project and making use of components.
- Demo: Create a barebones Next.js project with app directory support on the command line in 7 simple steps.
