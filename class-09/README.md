# 9. Static/Incremental rendering: Adding a blog or news page with static rendering (also we talk about /pages & /app)

## Overview

Generate a blog or news page with a list of posts, and individual pages for those posts, using Next.js's static generation and incremental regeneration features.

## Class Outline

- Lecture: Static vs Incremental vs Dynamic Rendering
- Lab: Render a blog index and individual pages for a dynamic list of posts, compare /app and /pages

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the differences between static and dynamic rendering in Next.js and why you might use each one
- How to generate static content pages using the /app directory using `generateStaticParams`
- An understanding of how Next.js achieved this prior to Next.js 13, using `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`.
