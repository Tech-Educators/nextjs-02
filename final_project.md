# Module 02 Project

Last week we created a blog, and this week we learned how to use a kv store to add comments to our posts, and using client and server components to get the best user experience.
Now you have a choice:
- Continue working on your Blog with the new technoligies we've learned this week
- Start a brand new project using all the technologies from the last 2 weeks

## Project Requirements

Your project must use the following technologies:

- It must be deployed on Vercel (remember the moving bones!)
- Use NextJS 13 (using create-next-app)
- At least two different Routes with Navigation
- At least one Dynamic Route Segment
- Make use of query strings at least once
- Each route should have appropriate meta tags
- Make sure it doesn't look like the default create-next-app app
  - Use at least one sort of CSS (plain CSS file, TailwindCSS, CSS modules, CSS-in-JS)
- Make use of `next/image`
- Have at least 2 fonts using `next/font`
- Make use of clerk.dev or some other 3rd party authorisation tool

## Enjoy this

The most important thing to achieve during this project is FUN!
Make sure the theme of your project is something you're interested in, it'll make it much easier to do!

## Presentations

We will present our projects at the end of Friday, remember to talk about:
- Your idea
- A problem
- Your solution
- Your next steps for the project
